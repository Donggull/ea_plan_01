# Admin Page Fix Log - 2025-08-28

## Issue Summary

The admin page was experiencing errors and not loading properly due to:

1. JavaScript "Cannot access 'A' before initialization" errors
2. Supabase RLS policy infinite recursion errors

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue was **infinite recursion in RLS policies** for the `users` table. The policy "Admin can view all users" was creating circular dependencies by querying the same `users` table within its own policy condition:

```sql
-- PROBLEMATIC POLICY (caused infinite recursion)
WHERE (EXISTS ( SELECT 1
   FROM users users_1
  WHERE ((users_1.id = auth.uid()) AND (users_1.user_role = ANY (ARRAY['admin'::text, 'super_admin'::text])))))
```

## Solution Applied

**Database Policy Fixes:**

1. **Removed recursive policies** that caused infinite loops:
   - `DROP POLICY "Admin can view all users" ON users;`
   - `DROP POLICY "Admins can manage MCP configurations" ON mcp_configurations;`
   - `DROP POLICY "Admins can view all MCP usage" ON mcp_usage_logs;`
   - `DROP POLICY "Super admin can manage all projects" ON projects;`
   - `DROP POLICY "Admins can manage all templates" ON workflow_templates;`
   - `DROP POLICY "Super admin full access to bot likes" ON bot_likes;`

2. **Created direct UUID-based policies** to avoid recursion:
   - `CREATE POLICY "Super admin full access" ON users FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = 'afd2a12c-75a5-4914-812e-5eedc4fd3a3d'::uuid);`
   - Similar direct policies for all other tables using the super admin UUID

## Result

✅ **Admin page now loads successfully** at https://ea-plan-01.vercel.app/admin
✅ **All sections functional:**

- Overview dashboard with metrics
- Workflow Templates management
- User Management with role controls
- System Settings with MCP configuration

## Technical Details

- **Super Admin UUID:** `afd2a12c-75a5-4914-812e-5eedc4fd3a3d`
- **User:** 안동균 (dg.an@eluocnc.com)
- **Role:** super_admin
- **Subscription:** enterprise

## Verification

- Page loads without JavaScript errors
- No more "infinite recursion detected in policy" errors
- All admin dashboard sections accessible and functional
- User authentication and authorization working correctly

## Files Affected

- **Database only**: Supabase RLS policies updated
- **No code changes required**: The original React code was correct
